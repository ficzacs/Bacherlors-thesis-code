This is the code used in my bachelors thesis. The aim of this thesis is to compare mapping and pathfinding algorithms on a grid-based map based on various properties, using a self-built program. 
The program is capable of mapping a top-down view of a field, navigating from a starting point to a target points able to avoid obstacles, including those that appear on the field after the initial mapping.
Once the target is reached, communicates the route taken to the user. 
Can quickly and dinamically run up to thousands of iterations, thus comparing the efficiency of the algorithms.
